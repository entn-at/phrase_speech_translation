# Get the lattices from Kaldi for each dataset that has been decoded
# dev, dev2 and test : Fisher
# Acoustic scale set to 1/W, where W led to the best WER
# --- The symbols for laugh, noise and OOV are hardcoded in the Kaldi2FST script. You should replace them (2038, 2039, 2040 in the default recipe)
# since they get replaced with eplison upon conversion
# --- Pruned with a beam width of 13.0
